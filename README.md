# Numix icon theme

Numix is the official icon theme from the [Numix Project](http://numixproject.org). It is heavily inspired by, and based upon parts of the Elementary, Humanity and Gnome icon themes. Numix is designed to be used along-side an application icon theme like [Numix Circle](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle) or [Numix Square](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-square). This readme provides information on [installation](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme#install-it) and [icon requests](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme#icon-requests).

## Install it

If using this with one of our app icon themes (like [Numix Circle](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle)) make sure you install both parts using the same method. This makes sure that the panel icons keep working as intended.

## Icon Requests
Application icon requests should be posted in the [Numix Circle](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle) issue tracker. Folder icons requests should be posted in the [Numix Folders](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-folders/issues) issue tracker. Action icons, indicators, file types and everything else should be posted here.

## Hardcoded Icons
To deal with hardcoded status icons Numix recommends you use the [Hardcode Tray](https://github.com/bil-elmoussaoui/Hardcode-Tray) script.
