Numix icon theme
================
Numix is the official icon theme from the [Numix project](http://numixproject.org). It is heavily inspired by, and based upon parts of the Elementary, Humanity and Gnome icon themes. Designed to be used along side the application icon theme [Numix Circle](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle). This readme provides information on [installation](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme#installation) and [icon requests](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme#icon-requests).
